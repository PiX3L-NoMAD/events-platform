1. Context (real or imagined business situation)

You have always dreamt of being a curator of antiquities and fine artworks, and now you have been approached by a coalition of all kinds of museums and universities, who want to create viewer driven virtual exhibitions. This will be of great use to researchers, students, and art lovers alike. 

2. High-level desired outcome

Users of the platform can enter key terms or choose from presets to create an extensive virtual exhibition. The artwork should have some images and some information associated with them. Users can navigate between different artworks, and be provided with links where they can find out more information, and where they can see the artwork in person. 

3. Minimum viable product

Either a website or mobile app where a user can provide some search criteria to filter and sort artworks. Images and core information about the artwork are displayed when a user interacts with a thumbnail or other indicator of an artwork from a list. The user can select which artworks they want to include in an exhibition they are creating which persists for the duration of their session.

4. Possible extensions

- permanence of exhibitions through a user profile and a BE to save favourite search combinations
- unique shareable links 
- AR integration
- both a website and a mobile app
- social media integration
- multiple search and filter criteria 

5. Non functional requirement

- Built in React or React Native. 
- Responsive design.
- Accessibility taken into consideration.
- Fast loading of high quality media content, or indication of loading times to the user. 

6. Performance criteria

The app should clearly communicate to users errors, if they occur, or if content is still loading. The design should be clear and obvious as to how to create a curated exhibition and how to view it.  

7. Non-binding tech suggestions

Consider using: 

- React 
- React Native
- TypeScript

8. Due date

5 working days from the start date, spread over 5 weeks.
