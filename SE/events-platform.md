1. Context (real or imagined business situation)

A small community business has reached out to you to create a platform where they can share events with members of the community. The staff at the business want an elegant way of creating and sharing these events via social media. A member of the community can add the event they signed up for to their personal calendar. Some of these events are offered for free, however others are paid for either with a set amount or a pay as you feel charge.  

2. High-level desired outcome

A platform where a business can share their events with members of the community, and community members can sign up and optionally pay to participate in an event. This can be a website or a mobile app, or both depending on the time you have available. 

3. Minimum viable product

A mobile app or a website which allows:
- creating events by staff
- signing up to events by non-staff
- adding events to Google calendar

5. Possible extensions

- social media integration
- payment platform integration
- both a website and a mobile app
- logging in using a Google account, or other social media
- confirmation emails when booked in for an event

6. Non functional requirements 

- Built in React or React Native. 
- Responsive design.
- Accessibility taken into account.
- Considerations taken for the security of users log in and payment information.

7. Performance criteria

The app should clearly communicate errors to users, if they occur, or if content is still loading. The design should be clear and obvious as to how an event can be created or signed up for. 

8. Non-binding tech suggestions

Consider using: 
- Free API to give your events platform a theme (plants, books, films, animals, running, coffees, etc.)
- React 
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Google API
- Stripe, Google pay, or another payments portal with a free tier
